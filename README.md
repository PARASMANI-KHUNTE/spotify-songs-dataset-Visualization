# spotify-songs-dataset-Visualization-
This project is a Python script designed to load, clean, and visualize music data from a .csv file. The script leverages pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, offering insights into song popularity, duration distribution, release trends, and more.

Features
Load music data from a .csv file.
Clean missing or invalid values in the dataset.
Generate visualizations:
Popularity by Genre: Displays average song popularity across genres.
Number of Songs by Release Year: Shows trends in song releases over time.
Duration Distribution: Visualizes the spread of song durations.
Top Labels by Song Count: Highlights the most prolific music labels.
Sample Data
Here is an example of the data format used in this project:

song_id	song_title	artist	album	genre	release_date	duration	popularity	stream	language	explicit_content	label	composer	producer	collaboration
SP0001	Space executive series.	Sydney Clark	What.	Electronic	1997-11-08	282.0	42	35055874	English	Yes	Def Jam	Amy Hatfield	Jeffrey Weaver
